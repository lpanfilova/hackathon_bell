              There are currently 7.9 billion people in the world, and our population
              is expected to grow to 10 billion by 2050. Traditional diets consisted
              primarily of meat with some meat. However, with industrial meat
              production, the production of and demand for meat has risen. Global meat
              production has increased from 71 million tonnes in 1961 to 341.16
              million tonnes in 2018, and this number is expected to keep growing. We
              will need to produce more food to feed a growing population, and it is
              important to understand the implications this will have on our global
              carbon footprint. A lot of land, water, and food is used to raise
              livestock, and as the the global population and the demand for meat
              continue to grow, it will become difficult to justify using these
              resources for livestock instead of directly feeding our population.

            <p>
              On the surface, it can seem like there is not much one person can do to
              reduce global greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. However, it is
              important to understand the impact each person can make collectively
              using their votes and their wallets. An individual's change in diet may
              not significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions from livestock,
              but multiple people reducing their meat intake will reduce local demand
              for livestock products, which can reduce local livestock production. You
              can also vote for sustainability-minded politicians who will provide
              funding for meat substitute research and who can enact changes in their
              local livestock sectors through legislation.
